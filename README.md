# raar_show_descriptor

Store missing show descriptions from the rabe.ch website into archiv.rabe.ch.

See configuration in `config/settings.example.yml`. Copy this file to `config/settings.yml`, complete it and run `raar_show_descriptor.rb`.

This script is meant to be run manually, because new show descriptions are not added that often.
